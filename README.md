# Compose ta salade ! ðŸ¥—

Compose ta salade ! is a side-project designed to train in programming. The first version is in native JavaScript, but I want to completely rebuild it using React. 
The current functionnalities are:
- [x] Recovering the date to offer only seasonal choices;
- [x] Choose a base, choose one or more protein sources, choose one or more seasonal vegetables... ;
- [x] A summary of the salad's composition;
- [x] The option of emailing your salad composition via a share popup; 
- [x] Start the salad from scratch.

I am currently working on the app to add loads of more functionnalities:
Easy:
- [ ] 1. Add a cross to close the pop-up (which currently only closes when you click outside)
- [ ] 2. A real-time summary of the ingredients added to the salad
- [ ] 3. Filter ingredients according to preferences (vegetarian, vegan, fish-eater, gluten-free, local)
- [ ] 4. Share on social networks (not just by email)
- [ ] 5. Add a â€˜saucesâ€™ category
- [ ] 6. Added error messages for forms

Averages: 
- [ ] 1. Overhaul the selection system: display categories (bases, fillers, etc.) as retractable. 
- [ ] 2. Add a â€˜guideâ€™ tab showing what a portion of pasta or a portion of vegetables corresponds to, etc. 
- [ ] 3. Customise the quantity of ingredients
- [ ] 4. Calculate the total price of the salad (based on quantities)
- [ ] 5. In the summary, display a line marked â€˜allergens: [...]â€™.
- [ ] 6. Suggest several ways of cooking the ingredient (e.g. smoked salmon, salmon fillet, etc.).
- [ ] 7. Add a dark mode

Difficult:
- [ ] 1. Save and load salads 
- [ ] 2. Summary of nutritional values
- [ ] 3. Connect with the â€˜Nutritionixâ€™ API to obtain precise nutritional data
- [ ] 4. Filter ingredients according to several criteria at the same time
- [ ] 5. Suggest random salads (add attributes to ingredients in terms of colour, texture, etc. and then suggest â€˜colourful saladsâ€™, â€˜summer saladsâ€™, â€˜crispy saladsâ€™, etc.).
- [ ] 6. Add a â€˜salad comparatorâ€™ (users can compare 2 salads in terms of price, nutritional value, etc.).

To go further:
- [ ] 1. View other people's public salads, rate them and leave comments.
- [ ] 2. You can add an ingredient as a â€˜favouriteâ€™, which will then appear in a â€˜favouritesâ€™ category. 
- [ ] 3. Create categories to save your salads
- [ ] 4. Create a â€˜quizâ€™ to help the user design a salad
- [ ] 5. Add an ingredient search before validating the salad â€˜An ingredient in your fridge? An essential ingredient? Add it now!
- [ ] 6. Add a small i in a circle to each ingredient to give information about its attributes (g in a portion, season, nutritional values).
- [ ] 7. Display statistics in the user profile (number of salads created, most added ingredients, etc.).

Feel free to check my progress !
